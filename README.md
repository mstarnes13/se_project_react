WTWR (What to Wear?)

Intro - About the project

The concept of the WTWR application is to make a call to an external API (OpenWeather), which then responds with the daily weather forecast for a specific city. The WTWR application then collects this weather data, processes it, and then based on the forecast, recommends suitable clothing for the user.

Figma Design
Figma was used to map out the design for this single page application. The Figma design was supplied by TripleTen. This design includes detailed views of each component used within the react application. The images and logos were also supplied within the Figma design. The design also includes detailed information for building the different screen-size applications.
